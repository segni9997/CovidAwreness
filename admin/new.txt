convergence 
an imortant cahrachtersitucs of routing protocol
is how quickly it coverges when where is a change




a network is not completlty oparable until the
has converged thefore most networks require short convergence
convergence properties include the spped of propagtion of routing information and the calculation of optimal paths
the faster the convergence the better the routing protocol
Generally RIP and IGRP are slow to converge ehre as EIGRP
 OSPF ans IS-IS  are faster  to converge

 * preventong routing loops -bsed on subnets
 Hold-down timers:- allow routers to not accept any changes 
 split horizon rule:- a router should not advertise network through the interface from which the update come 






 classfull routing protocols cannot be usef when a network is sub-netted using more than one subnetting mask
