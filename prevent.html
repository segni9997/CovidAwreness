<h1><span>How</span> to Protect Yourself and Others</h1>
<h2><span>COVID-19</span>  Prevention Actions</h2>
<p>There are many ways your actions can help protect you, your household, and your community from severe illness from COVID-19. <br>CDC’s COVID-19 Community Levels provide information about the amount of severe illness in the community where you are located to help you decide when to take action to protect yourself and others.</p>

    <li>
     
        <span> Wash</span> your hands frequently and carefully</span.></li>
        <img src="images/handwash.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">
    <p> Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails.<br> You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap.<br>
    Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day, especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop.</p>

    <li><span>Avoid</span> touching your face</li>

          <p>SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you touch a surface like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>gas pump handle</li>
           <li> your cell phone</li>
            <li>a doorknob</li>
        </ul><br>
    
        <li><span>Stop</span> shaking hands and hugging people</li>
         <img src="images/handshake.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">
   <p>Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin-to-skin contact can transmit SARS-CoV-2 from one person to another.</p>
 
   <li><span>Don’t</span> share personal items</li>
    <img src="images/items.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">
<ul>
    <li>phones</li>
      <li>makeup</li>
     <li>combs</li>
 </ul><br>

 <li><span>Cover</span> your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze</li>
  <img src="images/mouth.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">
 <p>SARS-CoV-2 is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth.<br> This means it can be carried by air droplets to other people when you cough, sneeze, or talk. <br>It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3 days.
Use a tissue or sneeze into your elbow to keep your hands as clean as possible. Wash your hands carefully after you sneeze or cough, regardless.</p>

<h1>Treatments for <span>COVID-19</span></h1>
<p>Most people who become ill with COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.<br> Some of the same things you do to feel better if you have the flu — getting enough rest, staying well hydrated, <br>and taking medications to relieve fever and aches and pains — also help with COVID-19.<br>

Beyond that, the FDA has also authorized treatments that may be used for people who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 and other medications to curb the progression of COVID-19<br> in people who are not hospitalized but who are at risk for developing severe illness. Scientists continue working hard to develop other effective treatments</p>
<p>The NHS offers treatments to people with coronavirus <span>(COVID-19)</span> who are at the highest risk of becoming seriously ill.<br>

<span>treatments </span>available are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (<span>Paxlovid</span>)</li>
<li>remdesivir (<span>Veklury)</span></li>
<li>molnupiravir (<span>Lagevrio</span>)</li>
<li>sotrovimab (<span>Xevudy</span>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Nirmatrelvir, ritonavir, remdesivir and molnupiravir are <span>antiviral</span> medicines.<br>

Sotrovimab is a biological medicine also known as a neutralising monoclonal antibody (nMAb). Sotrovimab may be given to people if antiviral medicines are unsuitable for them to take.<br>

These treatments can help some people manage their COVID-19 symptoms and reduce the risk of becoming seriously ill.</p>
<h2>Who can have a <span>COVID-19</span> treatment</h2>
<p>You're eligible for these COVID-19 treatments if you have not been admitted to hospital and all of the following apply</p>
<ul>
    <li>you're aged 12 or over</li>
<li>you're at highest risk of getting seriously ill from COVID-19</li>
<li>you have symptoms of COVID-19, which are not getting better</li>
<li>you have tested positive for COVID-19</li>
</ul>
